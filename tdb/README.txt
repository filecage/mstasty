    This is the directory for your "virtual databases".
    They can all be read by simply using file_get_contents()
    or any function similar to it.
    It's also possible saving files in different datatypes
    over here, just like XML, INI or even executable binaries.

    This directory needs chmod +660 or, if you're using
    binaries, chmod +770.
