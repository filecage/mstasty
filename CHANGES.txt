=================================================
Changes in rev4:

- Fixed a bug in the parser where /msg MsTasty would be a private message and /msg mstasty not
- Fixed a bug where the $core -> ctcp () would send a PRIVMSG instead of a NOTICE (which would be a request and not a response)
- Added IRCCore::core_handler to handle CTCPs, Nickchanges and other relevant stuff
- Added usleep(5000) when handling the stream in noblock mode, which saves worlds of cpu
- Added references of core-objects required for modules in core::modules
- Added an http_handler to allow developers making asynchronous http requests by using file_get_contents() (will later be replaced by an own http-handler)
- Fixed a bug where ERROR_REPORTING would be set to E_ERROR after loading a module.
- Optimized core_module managing (including RAM management). Loaded core modules will now only be instanced once, otherwise they would exist x<number of registered events> (i.e. core_channels would exist 6 times)
- Added global function parse_vars( $str, $opt=array(), $seperated='%' ) to functions.lib.php to enable parsing textvars.
- Added a check to the core::main, to delete possible registered commands from unloaded modules
- Added new replace vars to send function. You can now use %nick% in all snd(). It will be replaced by the bots current nick.
- Fixed a bug where the check for block-timers (more than 200 seconds) where only checked during non-block periods (which would cause timers with more than 200 seconds never to occur)
- Changed a process in the parser to optimize parsing text messages
- Fixed a bug in the parser where arguments after : are not parsed well if there are no arguments between COMMAND and : (e.g. incoming NICK changes)
- Created a new module rssreader to read rssfeeds. See /cfg/rssreader.cfg.php for config infos.
- Removed option BOT:timermode (default set to by_noblock)
- Added module decide.php (taken from the old mstasty), can be used by !decide <option1> <option2> "<option3 as sentence>"
- Added module dns.php to resolve DNS or lookup IPs. Can be used by ?dns <target>

=================================================
Changes in rev3:

- Set the time_limit to 0 (deactivated) which allows the bot to run longer than the earlier value 160s
- Added a PONG in the main core (no module required)
- Fixed a bug in the parser where prefixed idents (~) won't be recognized (and not ignored)
- Added wildcard binds for $core -> register (i.e. registering !* will match !foo, !bar, registering ! not)
- Added a new function to has_flags and get_rights: $mask can now be the $in['sender'] array returned by the parser, which allows ignoring a ~-ident prefix
- Validated the language files and added new translations to CORE_DE
in rev3.1:
- Fixed a bug where the parser would classify the PING from the server as SENDER (and :irc.servername.org as command), which would cause the bot to disconnect due to ping timeout

=================================================


=================================================
Changes in rev2.1:

- fixed a bug which would cause the bot to crash after a module has been rehashed
